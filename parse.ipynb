      "'''Sheepshead Bay''' is a [[bay]] separating the [[mainland]] of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], from the eastern portion of [[Coney Island]], the latter originally a barrier island but now effectively an extension of the mainland with [[peninsula]]s both east (the neighborhood of [[Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn|Manhattan Beach]]) and west (the neighborhoods of Coney Island and [[Sea Gate, Brooklyn|Sea Gate]]).  The mouth of the bay is about {{convert|1.0|mi|km}} southwest of [[Marine Park, Brooklyn]].

      "==History==\n",
      "The name 'Sheepshead Bay' also applies to the neighborhood north of the bay, not just the bay itself. Sheepshead Bay was named for the [[Sheepshead (Archosargus)|sheepshead]],<ref>http://brooklynbased.net/email/2009/05/the-naming-of-sheepshead-bay/</ref> an edible [[fish]] once found in the bay's waters; even though it is rare, the fish can still be caught in the local waters every once in a while. The bay itself was originally the easterly entrance to [[Coney Island Creek]], but filling of the central part of this waterway during the 1930s in conjunction with construction of the Shore Parkway portion of the [[Belt Parkway]] eliminated access to the [[Stream|creek]]. At the same time the bay was widened at its western end, deepened and [[Bulkhead (barrier)|bulkheaded]]. It is now the home of recreational fishing fleets. The fishing fleet has been shrinking every year and is being replaced by dinner boats. At the western end of the bay, there is [[Holocaust]] Memorial Park, which is used throughout the year for commemorative events.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the last decade of the 20th century, a [[real estate]] boom brought the reopening of the landmark [[Lundy's Restaurant|Lundy Brothers seafood restaurant]], which closed again in 2007. A grocery store now takes its place. [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-style restaurants/nightclubs such as Paradise and Baku Palace have opened along the waterfront. It has also experienced a growth of condominium developments.  Emmons Avenue, the northern shoreline street along the bay, has piers with an active seafood market and tour boats.\n",

      "'''Macombs Dam Park''' is a park in the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[the Bronx]]. The park lay in the shadow of the [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|old Yankee Stadium]] when it stood, between [[Jerome Avenue (Bronx)|Jerome Avenue]] and the [[Interstate 87|Major Deegan Expressway]], near the [[Harlem River]] and the [[Macombs Dam Bridge]]. The park is administered and maintained by the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].  The majority of Macombs Dam Park has not been open to the public since August 2006, when construction began on the new [[Yankee Stadium]].\n",
      "\n",
      "The {{convert|28.425|acre|m2|sing=on}} park, prior to the stadium construction, featured [[baseball]] and [[softball]] diamonds, [[basketball]] courts, and [[American football|football]] and [[Football (soccer)|soccer]] fields.<ref name=Park/> Portions of the park are often used during [[New York Yankees]] home games to provide [[overspill parking]] for vehicles in an area underserved by garages and other parking facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "==History==\n",
      "Macombs Dam Park opened in 1899, when the Bronx was mostly farmland.<ref name=Park>[http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=6335 MACOMBS DAM PARK], [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]]. Accessed September 29, 2007.</ref> As was typical for urban planning at that time, a large, central greenspace was set aside to ensure that the developing neighborhood would be livable and sustainable. This same type of development had already been thriving around Manhattan's [[Central Park]] and [[Brooklyn]]'s [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]], among several other New York locations. Parks advocates contend that Macombs Dam Park is no less valuable than Central Park or Prospect Park, which are both in much wealthier neighborhoods. Macombs Dam Park is in [[New York's 16th congressional district]], the poorest in the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yankee Stadium opened in 1923 and the [[Bronx County Courthouse]], two blocks east on [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]], opened in 1934. Most of the neighborhood's apartment buildings opened in the 1920s and 1930s, including many [[Art Deco]] landmarks that line the perimeter of what had been Macombs Dam Park.\n",
      "\n",
      "==New Yankee Stadium's impact on the park==\n",
      "===Replacement parkland===\n",
      "Bronx officials had promised that replacement parks would be built before the stadium project began. When the stadium construction began with no new parks in place, city officials then said they would be completed by 2007. When the $1.6 billion stadium is completed, in 2009, residents will have several new recreation areas. Some of the recreation areas will be ballfields on the Harlem River waterfront, about a half-mile from where Macombs Dam and [[Mullaly Park]]s had been. Currently, accessing the waterfront requires walking under the [[Major Deegan Expressway]] and over railroad tracks from Metro-North's [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]]. Other recreation areas will be built on top of parking garages where the parks had been; these will be closed on game days, which make up 81 days of the 183 days between April and September, to accommodate fans' cars. The roofs of the garages will be lined with artificial surface and counted as replacement parkland by New York City. Other replacement recreation areas will be atop the {{convert|9|acre|m2|adj=on}} site of the old Yankee Stadium. The above ground structure of the ballpark, built in 1923, will be completely torn down, with the underground clubhouses remaining in use for the new parkland.\n",
      "\n",
      "===Financing===\n",
      "The new recreation areas will cost at least $150 million, paid for entirely by New York City taxpayers. (There is no cap on public spending for the Yankees' stadium.) City officials say the neighborhood will benefit from the new recreation areas. Residents say they prefer a park of central, continuous greenspace to the smaller, scattered ballfields. Renovating Macombs Dam and John Mullaly parks would have cost about $25 million. The city's parks department will retain ownership of the land where the Yankees' new stadium will be, but will not charge the Yankees rent or property taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "===Controversy===\n",
      "Residents and parks advocates had criticized the Yankees' changes to the neighborhood, which included cutting down 377 mature oak trees. They said state and federal laws designed to protect parkland from private development made this project unfair and possibly illegal. Community advocates said at the time they still planned to fight the project in court, even as construction crews have blocked off their parkland and begun tearing down its trees.  According to the city's Environmental Impact Statement for the Yankees' stadium project, several buildings surrounding Macombs Dam Park may become blighted when the project is completed. Opponents to the construction of the new Stadium were defeated and the Stadium officially opened on April 3, 2009, for an [[exhibition game]] against the [[Chicago Cubs]].\n",

He used city government to combat housing bias and job discrimination.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of these activities, programs, and concepts are reflected in the Wagner Collection, which consists of correspondence, transcripts of 3,000 speeches, over 7,000 photographs, personal artifacts, and a 100-interview oral history collection.

It excluded Catholics, African-Americans and Jews, and soon became synonymous with the city's elite. In 1905, local historian Edmund Platt described as \"the first club of any importance\". \"Much of Poughkeepsie's growth was decided at the Amrita Club's dinner table\", writes Carolyn Burke in her biography of [[Lee Miller]], whose father was a member during her childhood.<ref name=\"Lee Miller\">{{cite book |title=Lee Miller: A Life |last=Burke |first=Carolyn |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago, Illinois |isbn=0-226-08067-6 |pages= |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/08/books/chapters/0108-1st-burke.html?pagewanted=all | date=2006-01-08 | accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref>\n",

Unoccupied, it decayed until 1999 when Decision Technologies International (DTI), a software consulting firm based in nearby [[Wappinger, New York|Wappinger]], reached a deal with the city to renovate the building and use it as its [[corporate headquarters|headquarters]]. The city committed $800,000 in urban-redevelopment [[grant (money)|grants]] to help the company.<ref name=\"2002 Weekly Beat story\">{{cite news|last=Densmore|first=Steve|title=City Pulls Plug on Amrita Club|url=http://www.weeklybeat.net/2002/08/09/citypullsplugamrita.html|work=The Weekly Beat|date=2002-08-09|accessdate=2008-10-10}}</ref>\n",

      "The institutional history of the school goes back to the founding, prior to 1841, of the African Free School in the old [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn#Incorporation of Williamsburgh|Town of Williamsburgh]], which was consolidated into the City of Brooklyn in 1855.  The Brooklyn Board of Education renamed it \"Colored School #3\" and continued to run it while pursuing an overall policy of segregated education, even after the [[State of New York]] passed a law ostensibly desegregating the state's schools in 1873.  By 1879 the school had become overcrowded, and parents petitioned the school board for a new building.  Samuel Leonard (1821-1879), who was in charge of school construction in Brooklyn from 1859 to 1879, drew up plans in the Romanesque Revival style that was popular for school buildings at that time.  The building, with four classrooms for 220 students, was completed in 1881 at 270 Union Avenue, at a cost of $8,963.<ref name=Landmark />\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after the school's construction, the practice of school segregation in Brooklyn began to change.  In 1882, [[Seth Low]], the new mayor of Brooklyn and a reformer, appointed Phillip A. White as the first African-American member of Brooklyn's Board of Education.  White, who became the chairman of a committee in charge of the city's \"colored\" schools, opposed forced segregation and disliked the term \"colored school.\"  During White's tenure, African-American students were given the option to attend integrated schools, and Colored School #3 was renamed P.S. 69, making its name consistent with those of integrated schools though it continued to serve an exclusively African-American student body (the other two colored schools were similarly renamed).  By 1890, most African-American students chose to enroll in the integrated schools, and the enrollments of the colored schools had begun to decline.  In 1898 Brooklyn was consolidated into New York City and the school came under the jurisdiction of the city's Board of Education. In 1901, P.S. 69 ceased to exist as an independent entity due to the declining African-American population of the neighborhood.  Its building was used as an annex to other local public schools and as a school named P.S. 191 before being relinquished by the Board of Education in 1934.<ref name=Landmark />\n",

      "It was then used by other city agencies before becoming vacant for a period of time.  In 1982 the city sold the property, and in 1983 it was purchased by a sculptor, James O. Clark, for use as a private family residence and studio.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|last=Whitaker|first=Barbara|title=Habitats/270 Union Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn; Former 'Colored School' Houses Artist and Studio|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/01/realestate/habitats-270-union-avenue-williamsburg-brooklyn-former-colored-school-houses.html|accessdate=24 February 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=3 March 1998}}</ref>  Clark continues to occupy the building in 2014.<ref name=Clark>{{cite web|title=Artist's website|url=http://www.jamesoclark.com|publisher=James O.

      "'''Port Morris''' is a neighborhood in the southwest [[Bronx]], [[New York City]]. It is a heavily [[Industry|industrial]] neighborhood. Its boundaries are the [[Major Deegan Expressway]] and [[Bruckner Expressway]] to the north, East 149th Street to the east, the East River to the southeast, the [[Bronx Kill]] south, and the Harlem River to the west. Oak Point, the southern tip of the [[South Bronx]] is in Port Morris. Bruckner Blvd, which runs under the Expressway, is the primary thoroughfare through Port Morris. Most of the neighborhood is within walking distance from the [[Cypress Avenue (IRT Pelham Line)|Cypress Avenue]] station of the [[IRT Pelham Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Pelham local}}). Zip codes include 10454. The neighborhood is served by the NYPD's 40th Precinct.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_040.shtml 40th Precinct], [[NYPD]].</ref>\n",

      "Though almost entirely industrial, Port Morris does contain two small residential pockets where about 1,500 people live. Most live in poverty. Over half the population receives public assistance ([[TANF]], [[Home Relief]], [[Supplemental Security Income]], and [[Medicaid]]). The vast majority of residents in the area are of [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] descent.\n",

      "== History ==\n",
      "There is some evidence that a British paymaster ship went down off its coast, during the Revolutionary war with millions of dollars in gold aboard. No recovery was ever made.\n",
      "\n",
      "The name comes from a deep water port established along the neighborhood's East River ([[Long Island Sound]]) waterfront by [[Gouverneur Morris Jr.]], son of [[Gouverneur Morris]], in 1842. He built a two mile (3&nbsp;km) railroad from [[Melrose, Bronx|Melrose]] to his family's holdings on the waterfront, abandoned a hundred years later.<ref>[http://ltvsquad.com/2009/12/23/port-morris-branch-the-so-called-bronx-swamp/ Port Morris Branch, the so-called Bronx Swamp] December 23rd, 2009, The LTV Squad</ref>  The area is dominated by factory and warehouse buildings constructed in the mid-to-late 19th century, convenient to the railroad yards, of which the [[Oak Point Yard]] is the main survivor. Notable early businesses were the R. Hoe Co., as well as Cutler & Hammer Tool Works, and Mothers Friend Shirt Waist factory (1888) at Willow Ave. between E. 135th & E. 136th Sts. \n",

      "The area was the site of the Hell Gate generating plant of [[Consolidated Edison]], where [[George Metesky]], the Mad Bomber who plagued NYC for decades was injured. While many of the early industrial buildings remain, much of the manufacturing has long since left the area. The most notable architectural/engineering feature of Port Morris is the northern approach to the [[Hell Gate Bridge]] supported by concrete arches (1917) northward from East 132nd Street, between Willow & Walnut Avenues.

      "\n",
      "The history of Port Morris, as with other neighborhoods, is sometimes confused by the lack of fixed official boundaries.  Late in the 20th century the name was sometimes applied to the area to the west, into Mott Haven. Mott Haven by older definition lies to the west rather than north of Port Morris.\n",

In 1974 the divisions were merged to become a fully coeducational school. In 1977 it was turned over to a community-based board of trustees and became known as Mater Christi Catholic High School. The school motto was \"That They May Have Life More Abundantly\". In 1980 the school announced an affiliation with [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]].

The area is part of [[Brooklyn Community Board 18]].<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/cau/html/cb/cb_brooklyn.shtml Brooklyn Community Boards], [[New York City]]. Accessed December 31, 2007.</ref> \n",

      "\n",
      "The area was called Equandito (Broken Lands) by the local [[Lenape]] Native Americans, who sold it in 1664 to John Tilton, Jr. and Samuel Spicer. During the seventeenth century it became part of [[Flatlands, Brooklyn|Flatlands]], and [[tide mill]]s were built on it; the land was owned from 1675 by Jan Martense Schenck and between 1818 and 1870 by the wife of General [[Philip S. Crooke]]. The [[Jans Martense Schenck house|Crooke-Schenck House]], which stood at East 63rd Street, was dismantled in 1952 and later reassembled as a museum exhibit at the [[Brooklyn Museum]]. The area retained its rural character until Robert L. Crooke built a lead-smelting plant in 1890. The Crooke Smelting Company was bought out by the National Lead Company, and Crooke sold the remainder of the land to the firm of McNulty and Fitzgerald, which erected bulkheads and filled in the marshes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until the early twentieth century, the chief resources were the abundant crabs, oysters, and clams in [[Jamaica Bay]]. In 1906, the Flatbush Improvement Company brought marshland and engaged the firm of [[Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Steamship Company|Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific]] to dredge creeks and fill in meadows. Eventually, the parcel had an area of {{convert|332|acre|km2}} and was fit for industrial development, and within a decade [[NL Industries|National Lead]], [[Gulf Oil|Gulf Refining]], and other leading firms engaged in heavy industry opened plants there. Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific bought the land in 1909 and built three large drydocks employing a thousand workers; it also began promoting Jamaica Bay as a major harbor but failed to attract a large volume of shipping. A project begun in 1913 and completed in 1923 to extend [[Flatbush Avenue (Brooklyn)|Flatbush Avenue]] to the [[Rockaway Inlet]] provided an additional {{convert|2700|ft|m}} of dock facilities and a strip of land for a road across the marshes. In 1915, a channel was dredged to the main channel of Jamaica Bay, and a bulkhead and wharfage platform were built on the mainland side of Mill Creek. By 1919, Mill Island was the site of at least six manufacturing and commercial concerns. During the late 1920s and 1930s, the docks were rented to a number of small industrial firms. The neighborhood remained a grimy industrial area for thirty years, but its further development was hindered when plans for rail service to the rest of Brooklyn went unrealized. \n",
      "\n",
      "Residential development began after [[World War II]], when Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific sold to the firm of Flatbush Park Homes the land bounded to the north by [[Avenue U]], to the east by East 68th Street and East Mill Basin / Mill Island, to the south by Basset Avenue, and to the west by Strickland Avenue and Mill Avenue. Brick [[bungalow]]s were built in the late 1940s and early 1950s, many of which were later replaced by large, custom-built, detached one-family houses on lots measuring fifty by one hundred feet.\n",

After 30 years, he contracted [[Detlef Lienau]], one of a number of European-born architects working in America, to design a riverside villa for him. It was originally located on {{convert|65|acre|ha}}, the sole house between the [[Albany Post Road]] (now [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US 9]]) and the river in what has since become the Ardsley-on-Hudson section of Irvington.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n",
      "\n",
      "Lienau insisted on French stone to be true to the appearance of its Continental models. Cottenet called on him again to remodel and expand the house in the late 1850s, just a few years after moving in. The locally-based [[Lord and Burnham Building|Lord and Burnham]] Company built the conservatory.<ref name=\"IHS page\">{{cite web|title=NUITS|url=http://www.irvingtonhistoricalsociety.org/nrhp/nrhp05.html|accessdate=2008-06-15}}</ref> The resulting structure was often pointed out to passengers on [[steamship]]s going up the Hudson, with the implication that it was the ideally tasteful home of a man of wealth.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n",
      "\n",
      "After Cottenet's death in 1884, it passed to another wealthy local, [[Cyrus West Field]], who had to sell a year later due to some unexpected financial setbacks. During his brief ownership, he placed in the [[deed]] restrictions on the property's future use, banning it from being used for certain purposes, such as industry, education, or sale to \"disreputable\" individuals. These remain in place, and ensure that it has been used only as a residence ever since.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n",
      "\n",
      "His buyer was [[John Jacob Astor III]], who lived out the few years remaining in his life on the property. During that time, he managed to spend $100,000 on improvements, and built the stone gateway that still stands at Route 9 (now known as Broadway).<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" /> His heirs sold the house to [[Manhattan College]], which spent the next few years trying to clear Field's restrictions from the deed and convert the home to [[institution]]al use. Failing, the college sold to Amzi Lorenzo Barber, the \"[[Asphalt]] King\", a pioneer in [[Pavement (material)|paving]] as well as other businesses that would become prominent in the coming century. He sold off most of the surrounding acreage, clearing the way for the development of Ardsley-on-Hudson.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n",

Krapp]]. It had the capacity to seat 2,000 people. On its opening night, it once screened a pre-release version of [[Buster Keaton]]'s comedy film, the ''[[Battling Butler]]''. Later in 1952, it was sold to the St. Sebastian Roman Catholic parish in order to found a chapel which was transformed into a church building. The construction of the church began with the demolition of the entrance and lobby of the theatre, where a [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque]] [[bell tower]] was erected. The theatre's original auditorium decor was kept and restored, along with \"the domed ceiling, 40 columns along the side walls that were returned to their original marble with gold leaf capitals\".<ref name=CT>[http://cinematreasures.org/theater/6406 Loew's Woodside Theatre, Woodside, New York, 58-02 Roosevelt Avenue, Woodside, NY 11377, USA], cinematreasures.org</ref>\n",

      "The streets of Queens are laid out in a semi-[[grid plan|grid]] system, with a numerical system of [[street name]]s (similar to Manhattan and the Bronx). Nearly all roadways oriented north-south are \"Streets\", while east-west roadways are \"Avenues\", beginning with the number 1 in the west for Streets and in the north for Avenues. In some parts of the borough, several consecutive streets may share numbers (for instance, 72nd Street followed by 72nd Place and 72nd Lane, or 52nd Avenue followed by 52nd Road, 52nd Drive, and 52nd Court), often causing confusion for non-residents. In addition, incongruous alignments of street grids, unusual street paths due to geography, or other circumstances often lead to the skipping of numbers (for instance, on Ditmars Boulevard, 70th Street is followed by Hazen Street which is followed by 49th Street).\n",
      "\n",
      "The structure of a Queens address was designed to provide convenience in locating the address itself; the first half of a number in a Queens address refers to the nearest cross street, the second half refers to the house or lot number from where the street begins from that cross street, followed by the name of the street itself. For example, to find an address in Queens, 14-01 120th Street, one could ascertain from the address structure itself that the listed address is at the intersection of 14th Avenue and 120th Street, and that the address must be closest to 14th Avenue rather than 15th Avenue, as it is the first lot on the block. This structure doesn't stop when a street is named either, assuming that there is an existing numbered cross-street. For example, [[Queens College]] is situated at 65–30 Kissena Boulevard, and is so named because the cross-street closest to the entrance is 65th Avenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "This confusion stems from the fact that many of the village street grids of Queens had only worded names, some were numbered according to local numbering schemes, and some had a mix of words and numbers. In the early 1920s a \"Philadelphia Plan\" was instituted to overlay one numbered system upon the whole borough. Subway stations were only partly renamed, thus now share dual names after the original street names. On the [[IRT Flushing Line]] in Sunnyside, there are [[33rd Street – Rawson Street (IRT Flushing Line)|33rd – Rawson St.]], [[40th Street – Lowery Street (IRT Flushing Line)|40th – Lowery St.]], [[46th Street – Bliss Street (IRT Flushing Line)|46th – Bliss St.]], [[52nd Street (IRT Flushing Line)|52nd St. – Lincoln Ave.]] and so forth. Numbered roads tend to be residential, although numbered commercial streets are not rare.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fair number of streets that were country roads in the 18th and 19th centuries (especially major thoroughfares such as [[New York State Route 25A|Northern Boulevard]], [[Queens Boulevard]], Hillside Avenue, and [[Jamaica Avenue (Queens)|Jamaica Avenue]]) carry names rather than numbers, typically though not uniformly called \"Boulevards\" or \"Parkways\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rockaway Peninsula does not follow the same system as the rest of the borough and has its own numbering system. Streets are numbered in ascending order heading west from near the Nassau County border, and are prefixed with the word \"Beach.\" Streets at the easternmost end, however, are nearly all named. Streets in [[Bayswater]], which is on Jamaica Bay, has its numbered streets prefixed with the word \"Bay\" rather than \"Beach\". Another deviation from the norm is [[Broad Channel, Queens|Broad Channel]]; it maintains the north-south numbering progression but uses only the suffix \"Road,\" as well as the prefixes \"West\" and \"East,\" depending on location relative to [[Cross Bay Boulevard (Queens)|Cross Bay Boulevard]], the neighborhood's major through street. Broad Channel's streets were a continuation of the mainland Queens grid in the 1950s; formerly the highest numbered avenue in Queens was 208th Avenue rather today's 165th Avenue in Howard Beach & Hamilton Beach.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other exception is the neighborhood of Ridgewood, which for the most part shares a grid and [[house numbering]] system with the Brooklyn neighborhood of [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]]. The grid runs east-west from the LIRR [[Bay Ridge Branch]] [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] to Flushing Avenue; and north-south from Forest Avenue in Ridgewood to Bushwick Avenue in Brooklyn before adjusting to meet up with the [[Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bedford-Stuyvesant]] grid at Broadway.

Republican strength is concentrated in the western part of the county, which is mostly [[rural]] or [[exurban]]. In 2005, the Democrats gained a majority on the Saratoga Springs City Council after decades of Republican dominance.  The Republicans, however, reclaimed the council majority in the 2007 General Elections due to a split Democratic Party in the mayor's race.  In 2009, the Republicans reclaimed their supermajority (4-1) on the City Council, by winning every contested election  (Mayor, Finance, Public Safety, and Public Works). In 2011, Democrats reclaimed the Majority on the City Council, while Republican Scott Johnson was reelected as Mayor.   At the Saratoga County Board of Supervisors, the City is split, with one Republican and one Democrat holding the two Supervisor seats.\n",
